<h1><strong>The Customer Class</strong></h1>
<p><br>In the context of our problem domain, what must the Customer class know? The description directly mentions the following items, which are all data attributes of a customer:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>the customer’s name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the customer’s address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the customer’s telephone number</p>
<p>These are all values that can be represented as strings and stored as data attributes. The Customer class can potentially know many other things. One mistake that can be made at this point is to identify too many things that an object is responsible for knowing. In some applications, a Customer class might know the customer’s email address. This particular problem domain does not mention that the customer’s email address is used for any pur- pose, so we should not include it as a responsibility.</p>
<p>Now, let’s identify the class’s methods. In the context of our problem domain, what must the Customer class do? The only obvious actions are:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>initialize an object of the Customer class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>set and return the customer’s name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>set and return the customer’s address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>set and return the customer’s telephone number.</p>
</li>
</ul>
